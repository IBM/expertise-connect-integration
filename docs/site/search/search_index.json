Members of this association include telephone companies, cable operators, network operators, software suppliers, equipment suppliers and systems integrators. TM Forum members, including the world\u2019s largest service providers and suppliers such as IBM, have been working to develop APIs that support the TM Forum API Ecosystem. The TM Forum API Ecosystem is a family of over 50 REST APIs designed to make it easier to create, build and operate complex innovative services. This set of standard interfaces enables rapid, repeatable and flexible integration among operations and management systems. The APIs are based on the Business Process Framework (called eTOM), which is a critical component of Frameworx. Designed to enable end-to-end services for today\u2019s digital economy, Frameworx is the TM Forum\u2019s blueprint for successful business transformation. In the digital economy age, services are typically delivered through a sophisticated partnering of multiple providers that all use different systems and interfaces. The TM Forum REST-based APIs are designed for uses ranging from Internet of Things (IoT) device management to complex B2B value fabrics. They apply to API-driven scenarios such as IoT, digital health, smart grids, big data, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), next-generation operations support systems, business support systems (OSS/BSS) and more. The IBM Executive Sponsor for the TM Forum Open API Manifesto is Marisa Viveros, VP Strategy & Offerings \u2013 Telecom, Media and Entertainment Industries . This document describes the Open API Accelerator for Telco built by IBM Expertise Connect. The Accelerator is a Cloud-native asset based on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and leverages IBM Cloud Pak for Data for AI infusion. The TM Forum APIs are exposed through API Connect and DataPower Routing and data transformation implemented in IBM App Connect for Enterprise (ACE). IBM Event Streams manages order history, in-flight order events and notifications Sterling Order Management pipelines are used for Order state management Order decomposition and execution build plan decision system is provided by IBM Operation Decision Manager (ODM) The Open API Accelerator implements the TM Forum specifications for Product Ordering Management and provides consistent interactions with Order Negotiation systems such as Siebel and Salesforce Vlocity. Future releases will implement additional TM Forum Business Operations specifications. This asset also provides a framework for existing customers who use the Telco Pack to move CSP workloads to the Cloud. Components of this Accelerator have already been used to speed up delivery of a Proof of Concept at Saudi Telco Company.","title":"HomeTEST"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ibm-and-the-tmf-api-ecosystem","text":"The Telemanagement Forum, commonly referred to as \"TM Forum\" or \"TMF\", is a nonprofit industry association for service providers and their suppliers in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.

It deploys integration capabilities into the Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae managed container environment. IBM Cloud Pak for Integration uses the monitoring, logging, and security systems of Red Hat OpenShift to ensure consistency across all integration solutions. The IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Integration platform provides a unified framework for security, management operations, and resiliency. The managed container platform of a private cloud provides resiliency through the elasticity of container clusters and platform-level security. The unified management component provides ease of operations with a single view across all integration components within the platform. The gateway services provide runtime-level security and enforce access control policies to integration services. API Economy API adoption requires a capable API management platform, which provides enablers for an organization's API strategy throughout the entire API lifecycle. The platform includes capabilities for creating APIs, managing and securing them, and providing the runtime that hosts them. The API management platform consists of key components that provide needed capabilities. Those components are offered in a range of different deployment options to suit every organization's needs and environment along with underlying nonfunctional requirements. The API lifecycle management reference architecture bridges the gap between cloud and on-premises applications quickly and easily. It allows customers to securely unlock IT assets and to deliver innovative applications with modern architectures. Event-driven Event-driven architecture is a new addition to the publish/subscribe model for integration in the cloud. It uses event-streaming technologies to connect both cloud and on-premises workloads with cloud services and SaaS offerings, especially in AI and analytics. In the IBM Event-driven reference architecture, an event backbone provides the connectivity between the components, which include event sources, event streams, streaming analytics, and microservices.","title":"IBM CP4I Capabilites"},{"location":"cp4i-capabilities/#ibm-cp4i-capabilites","text":"","title":"IBM CP4I Capabilites"},{"location":"cp4i-capabilities/#ibm-cloud-pak-for-integration-capabilities","text":"IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Integration offers a single, unified platform for all enterprise integration needs.
